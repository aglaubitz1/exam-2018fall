        <p><!-- This is the second paragraph -->
            <span class="red">Babson</span> College is a private business school in Wellesley, Massachusetts,
            established in 1919. Its central focus is on entrepreneurship education, and it is often ranked the most
            prestigious entrepreneurship college in the United States.
        </p>
        <p> <!-- This is the third paragraph -->
            It was founded by Roger W. <span class="red">Babson</span> as an all-male business institute. Now co-ed, Babson College offers
            bachelor's degrees in business administration and undergraduate students have the opportunity to declare
            concentrations in more than twenty seven areas of study. Through Babson's F. W. Olin Graduate School of
            Business, the college also offers master's degrees in business administration, finance, accounting,
            entrepreneurial leadership and management. Often referred to as the "Entrepreneur's College", Babson is
            renowned for immersing its students in the entrepreneurial lifestyle and culture. Babson is also notable for
            its Foundations of Management and Entrepreneurship course, in which every enrolled first-year student
            starts, runs and dissolves a company. Babson currently offers undergraduates
            nearly sixty
            entrepreneurship-related courses. These courses are taught in tandem with various traditional liberal arts
            courses, which represent over 60% of the typical student's schedule. Every entrepreneurship course at Babson
            is taught by professors who have either started, sold, bought, or run successful businesses. Babson is
            considered very selective and currently has an undergraduate acceptance rate of 24%.

        <p><!-- This is the fourth paragraph -->
            <span class="red">Babson</span> College has consistently appeared on the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/entrepreneurship-rankings">U.S. News & World Report</a> rankings as the number one college
            in entrepreneurship education for nearly three decades. In 2014, CNN's Money Magazine named Babson the
            number one college in the country for value and in 2015 the magazine ranked it second. The Economist ranked
            Babson second on its 2015 list of best colleges and universities in outperforming earnings expectations.
            Babson's MBA program has also been ranked number one in entrepreneurship for over twenty years by U.S. News
            & World Report.
